A simple and elegant GNOME Shell extension that displays real-time currency conversion rates directly on your top panel.

## Features

*   **Real-time Rate Display**: See the latest conversion rate for your chosen currency pair in the GNOME top panel.
*   **Daily Change Indicator**: A visual icon (▲, ▼, or ―) shows you if the rate has gone up, down, or stayed the same since yesterday.
*   **Historical Data Chart**: A simple text-based line chart in the dropdown menu visualizes the rate trend over the last 10 days.
*   **Customizable Currencies**: Use the preferences window to select any base and target currency from a comprehensive list.
*   **Manual Refresh**: Instantly fetch the latest rates with a "Refresh" button in the menu.
*   **Resilient Design**: Works reliably using standard, legacy-compatible GNOME Shell features for maximum stability.
